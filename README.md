# Code-Analysis
- **Menu Options**:
  - `1. Add Student`: Allows you to add a new student to the system.
  - `2. Update Student`: Update existing student details.
  - `3. Delete Student`: Remove a student from the system.
  - `4. View All Students`: Display all students currently in the system.

## Design Decisions
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class in the system has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
- **DRY Principle**: Redundant code was eliminated by abstracting common functionalities.
- **KISS Principle**: The design was simplified to make the system easier to understand and use.

## Changelog
- Refactored code to improve adherence to SOLID principles and added a menu system.
- Initial version with basic CRUD operations for managing students.
